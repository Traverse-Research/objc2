# Examples

Various examples of using `objc2` and related crates.

See also the [`objc2` GitHub topic](https://github.com/topics/objc2) for various unofficial projects using `objc2`.

## Notes

Aim to be self-contained. The examples use explicit version numbers instead of `path = "../xyz"`, and instead we rely on a top-level `[patch.crates-io]` section to resolve it.
