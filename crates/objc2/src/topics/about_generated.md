# About the generated framework crates

The `objc2` project provides (mostly) autogenerated interfaces to Apple's
Objective-C frameworks like AppKit, Foundation, Metal, WebKit, and so on,
see [the full list of framework crates][crate::topics::frameworks_list].

The bindings currently contain some documentation from the headers, but you
should view [Apple's canonical developer documentation][apple-doc-index] for
detailed information about each API (there are [some plans][#309] for
importing that documentation, but it's difficult).

These crates use `objc2` to define the external interface to the
Objective-C classes and protocols. They also use the [`block2`] crate in
the public API, check out the documentation for that for how to call such
methods using a Rust closure.

See [the topics section][super] for more details.
