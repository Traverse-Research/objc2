error[E0271]: type mismatch resolving `<CustomObject as ClassType>::ThreadKind == dyn MainThreadOnly`

  = note: expected trait object `dyn MainThreadOnly`
             found trait object `(dyn AllocAnyThread + 'static)`
  = help: `(dyn AllocAnyThread + 'static)` implements `MainThreadOnly` so you could box the found value and coerce it to the trait object `Box<dyn MainThreadOnly>`, you will have to change the expected type as well
  = note: required for `CustomObject` to implement `MainThreadOnly`
note: required by a bound in `NSApplicationDelegate`

  = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::__define_class_inner` which comes from the expansion of the macro `extern_protocol` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
