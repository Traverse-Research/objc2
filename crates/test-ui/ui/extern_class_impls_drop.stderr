error[E0283]: type annotations needed

  = note: multiple `impl`s satisfying `MyClass: DoesNotImplDrop<_>` found in the `objc2` crate:
          - impl<Cls> DoesNotImplDrop<()> for Cls
            where Cls: ?Sized;
          - impl<Cls> DoesNotImplDrop<__macros::extern_class::checks::ImplsDrop> for Cls
            where Cls: Drop, Cls: ?Sized;
  = note: this error originates in the macro `$crate::__extern_class_inner` which comes from the expansion of the macro `extern_class` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
